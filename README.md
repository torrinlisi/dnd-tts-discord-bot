# dnd-tts-discord-bot

Work ongoing.

TODO

- Servers and voice channels should be programatically determined rather than in an env var
- Investigate if some kind of multithreading is necessary if on multiple different servers and being used simultaneously
- Add more dnd specific commands
- Improve TTS to offer more flexibility
- Add cap to text size so someone doesn't waste and entire budget
